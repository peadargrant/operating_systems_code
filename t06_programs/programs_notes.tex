\section{Machine code}

Programs are executed as binary machine code.

\section{Assembly language}

Assembly language is processor dependent!
It depends on what instruction set the processor implements.

\section{High-level languages}

C, C++, FORTRAN and others are considered high-level languages.
This meant historically that they were more understandable to read and write.
Consider a basic function in C to raise a number to a power: 

\inputminted{c}{program.c}

If we compile this to assembly language for an x86\_64 CPU we get: 

\inputminted{asm}{program.asm}
