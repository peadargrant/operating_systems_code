A set of jobs labelled A-D arrive simulataneously to a job scheduler implementing STCF all at t=10. The runtimes are:
A = 9
B = 2
C = 10
D = 6

(a) Determine the order in which scheduler will execute jobs.

(b) Determine the average response time of the 4 jobs.

(c) Determine the average turnaround time of the 4 jobs. 

(d) What scheduler could improve the response time?
